# FACIAL-RECOGNITION-FOR-CLASS-ATTENDANCE
Face Recognition System with Raspberry Pi and OpenCV
This project uses the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) to build a real-time face recognition system on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. The system is designed for computational efficiency and real-time applications, making it ideal for low-cost and reliable use in a variety of settings.

The project consists of three main phases: face detection and data gathering, training the recognizer, and face recognition. The system uses a camera module attached to the Raspberry Pi to detect faces, extract information from them, and compare the information to a known database to identify the person.

The system is built with a strong focus on practicality and ease of use. The aim is to provide a complete solution that can be easily customized and integrated into different applications. With this project, you can easily build a face recognition system that can be used for attendance tracking, security, or any other application that requires reliable face recognition.
